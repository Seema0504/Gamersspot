PASSWORD RECOVERY GUIDE
=======================

What to do if you forgot your password
---------------------------------------

If you forgot your admin password, you can reset it using the password reset script.

STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Open Terminal/PowerShell
   Navigate to your project folder:
   
   cd "c:\Dev\Gamers Spot\Version 2\Gamersspot"

2. Run the Password Reset Script
   
   node scripts/reset-password.mjs

3. Follow the Prompts

   The script will ask you:
   
   a) Enter new password (min 6 characters):
      - Type your new password
      - Press Enter
   
   b) Confirm new password:
      - Type the same password again
      - Press Enter
   
   c) Are you sure you want to reset the password? (yes/no):
      - Type "yes"
      - Press Enter

4. Success!
   
   You'll see a confirmation message with your new credentials.

5. Login
   
   - Open your browser
   - Go to http://localhost:5173/
   - Login with:
     Username: admin
     Password: [your new password]

EXAMPLE SESSION:
----------------

PS C:\Dev\Gamers Spot\Version 2\Gamersspot> node scripts/reset-password.mjs

Enter new password (min 6 characters): myNewPassword123
Confirm new password: myNewPassword123
Are you sure you want to reset the password? (yes/no): yes

Password reset successfully!

IMPORTANT NOTES:
----------------

- No Email Required - This is a direct database reset
- Immediate Effect - Password is changed instantly
- Secure - Password is hashed before storing
- Single Admin - Only works for the 'admin' user
- Local Access Required - You need access to the server/computer

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------

Error: Admin user not found
Solution: Run setup script first
  node scripts/setup-auth.mjs

Error: Database connection failed
Solution: Check your .env.local file has correct POSTGRES_URL

Error: Password must be at least 6 characters
Solution: Use a longer password

SECURITY BEST PRACTICES:
------------------------

1. Use Strong Passwords
   - Minimum 8 characters
   - Mix of letters, numbers, and symbols
   - Avoid common words

2. Don't Share Passwords
   - Keep your password private
   - Don't write it down in plain text

3. Change Regularly
   - Update your password periodically
   - Use the "Change Password" feature in the app
